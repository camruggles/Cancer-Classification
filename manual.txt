The data can be found in every folder titled “data.csv” and the read_clean.py processes the data.
PLEASE NOTE: SOME FILES HAVE SEEDS FOR RANDOMIZATION TO ALLOW TAS TO REPROUCE THE DATA IN OUR FINAL REPORT. 

Libraries to Install:
pip install -U scikit-learn

K-Means:
The bash script RUN_ME.sh should run all the files. The bash script also contains the individual commands. Please ignore anaconda warnings if any.

Kernel SVM: 
The bash script RUN_KERNEL in the folder kernel svm runs the command python kernelsvm.py. The hyperparameter tuning and LOOCV can take a long time to run. 

Perceptron: Please see the manual.txt file in perceptron folder

Understanding the Data:
The bash script RUN_ME.sh should run all the files. The bash script also contains the individual commands. Please ignore anaconda warnings if any.

Linear SVM:
The bash script runsvm.sh in folder svm runs all the necessary python programs. This includes hyperparameter tuning, bootstrapping, k-fold cross-validation, leave-one-out cross-validation, and ROC curves.

Things that take a long time to run:
- Linear SVM: Hyperparameter tuning, LOOCV
- Linear Perceptron: LOOCV
