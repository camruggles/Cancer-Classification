To run the code you can type in

run.sh

and it will print out the results for the mean of each of the following:
accuracy, error, precision, recall, specificity

on 10 fold cross validation or 10 bootstraps


or you could get the same results by running

for  k fold cross
python cv.py 10
or
for bootstrapping
python bootstrap.py 10


you can type in loocv.py to do leave one out cross validation


running these programs will save the data for accuracy, error, precision, recall, specificity
to a file called bootstrap#n.csv
or fold#n.csv
for n bootstraps and n folds respectively

the output csv files will contain a matrix formatted like this:

0  accuracy vector
1  error vector
2  precision vector
3  recall vector
4  specficity vector


the numbers 0-4 are added by the pandas library

each vector will be the metrics described that was generated by each fold or bootstrap of testing

the mean metrics printed by the program are the means of these vectors
